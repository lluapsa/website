title: "LLU APSA Newsletter"

LLU APSA is planning a series of interviews with practicing MD/PhDs. We will
distribute the answers to these interview questions in the form of an LLU APSA
Newsletter (and archive them on the LLU APSA website) in order to build up
resources for students to access now and in the future.

Example questions:

- What is your current job?
- Where did you do your MD/PhD training?
- Where did you do your residency/fellowship training?
- Did you do a postdoc? What are your thoughts about doing a postdoc?
- What do you wish you had known when you were an MD/PhD student?
- What advice do you have for choosing a specialty/residency program?
- Do you recommend doing research during residency? Why or why not?
